# MonstersMobileApp
##Unity game

This a pacman like game myself and John Lavin created with unity for windows phone 8 and android phones.
We started creating the maze and surrounded all the walls with 2d box colliders.
We then went on to create the hero which we surrounded with circle collider and a 2d rigid body collider. Then we gave him movement by where the user touches on the device.
We went on to create the food then, we made them so when the hero comes into contact with them he gets a score and the food object gets destroyed.
Then we created the monsters we gave them set paths to follow as so they could move around the map. Its no path finding algorithm but its still hard to evade them. We also made them get quicker over time to make it harder.
We have a basic main menu which displays the play button, quit button, the highscore and a toggle button to mute and unmet the music.
We also tried to add a server that holds highscores but could not figure it out, we left it in anyhow with some comments as to what it was meant to do.
To run this game on a windows 8 phone. Open the Monsters file up in visual studio connect a phone and run it to the phone.
To run this game on a android phone. Put the Monsters.apk file on the android phone and install it from there.
This was tested on an android phone and worked fine, So we have to assume it works on a windows phone. We could not test it on a windows phone as we didnâ€™t have one to test with.
